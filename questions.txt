Using an editor, answer the following questions:

NAME: Frank Yang

---------
example.c
---------
1) What is the cause of the seg fault in the program called example.c?

The i value in the for loop keeps increasing past the amount of characters in the array. So when the i goes above the max amount of characters in the array, the array's value is something like negative 12 million and it will get added to the sum.


--------
broken.c
--------
2) What line in broken.c did the program seg fault on?
line 28

3) What was the value of the variable "count" at the time of the seg fault?
10

4) What was the value of the variable "i" at the time of the seg fault?
633

5) What was the value of the variable "search" at the time of the seg fault?
1

6) What are the values in the "table" array?
5, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26

7) what do you think the bug is?
The conditional for the while loop is wrong. It should be a double equals instead of an equals sign. When the i value becomes equal to the count value and the search value turns into zero, the while loop reassigns the search back to one during the loop.
